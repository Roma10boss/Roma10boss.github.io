Overview:

I created a Ruby Command Line Interface (CLI) to access data from the Github Jobs API.
The main  object is to provise data from an API, also to scrape it and can also interact with the user.

Process:

I created something that allow every user to generate a fact about a random number chosen. 
The range is  is from 1 to 100, once the user input the data it will return a fact about that number. 
The hardest part of the CLI project was the starting nothing i chose was in my mind enough or as creative as i wanted it to be. And also it was the first time I was writing  a command line interface. However it was a fun and ever lasting experience that i am willing to try more pften.
