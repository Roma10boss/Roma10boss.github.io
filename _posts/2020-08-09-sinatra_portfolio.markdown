I had differents idea in my mind when i started this project it was easy deciding what i wanted to do. In the begining i wanted to create a reddit clone but i ran through many errors starting and was worrying about finishing on time so i had to drop it. 

My sinatra project is about a music lover who want to store information about his/her favorite music artist or band.
My Sinatra gem let you
   1)Create an account
   2)Add your favorite artist/concert
   3)Edityour favorite artist/concert
   4)Edit your account
   5)delete your account
   6)login and logout
The page once started let the user interact with it, the controller contains most of the essential of the program as it is the main source of what should happen once the server is up. I created it as user friendly as possible with basic level of css and html to make sure anyone reading the code can understand it. It was fun to do but there was bitter sweet while doing as it is for anything, the challenge was unmatched compare to the previous project. But at the end we get the better of it hopefully you enjoy it as much as i do
