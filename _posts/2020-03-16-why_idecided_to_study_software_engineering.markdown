Programming was always something I was passionate about since i was little. Programming  such as: analysis, algorithm generation, resource consumption, etc always seem to be awesome to me. My goal was always to find a way of creating the next big world changing app or program. Facebook was always the motivation for me, seeing where Zuckerberg came from and drastically change the world with an app that at least 70% of the world population know or are on it.

With those in mind when I went to school I was always looking for the right subject and major to match my passion.  After highschool i went to college but could not keep on going thats where flatiron school came clutch by allowing me to focus on the right subject and helping to build a base. Software development is fascinating as long as you have the drive to keep pusging through no matter how hard it can get, I am on this journey and I am loving it."
