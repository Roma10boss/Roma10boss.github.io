 My Rails portfolio projet is about a meal tracker a user can use to track either a weight lost or gain. 
The process was not easy , I wanted to meet the requirements and be on time, it was challenging. 
The goal was to get a user to create an account through this account the user would have a meal plan and could have many meal through this meal plan.

My home page is sample with welcoming the users ask them to sign up or login and can also signup with facebook. 
when log in you have the ability to create your meal, edit it or delete it. Other route let you have a meal place and keep tracking of your weight lost or gain. 

The challenging part was figure out what to do and put in in a guideline to follow. This program is still open to add other features which i would keep updating on my free time. From now anyone can add or request to add a specific features.
