This Javascript project has been a roller coaster from not finder a creative idea to taking a break mid project.
But thanksfully I was able to get through it. This program consist of heling users find an appropriate gift for their friends.
If you're undecided about what to get this program will give you the right idea.

We use an API to crete a custom shop letting you pick between roughtly 20 items the best fit for the receiver. 
After cloning, start your server and open hindex.html you will be presented with a signin/signup page after filling your info you will be login. from there you have them choice of picking the item or toggle it as your favorite with the like button. once you like an item you can get to your favorite page, clicking on their images will bring you the website to buy the product of your choice.
Designing that app wasn't easy as we run through a different error after one another. the most difficult part was finding something not too common. 

We enjoy every little bit of the project from the success to the failure, they gave us a better understanding as we were challenge to max. Hope you enjoy the program?
